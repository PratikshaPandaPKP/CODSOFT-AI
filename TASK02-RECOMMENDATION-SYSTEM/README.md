The project aimed to develop a comprehensive movie recommender system using demographic filtering, content-based filtering, and collaborative filtering techniques. Initially, the movie metadata and ratings datasets were imported and prepared, then merged to create a rich dataset for analysis. The first approach, demographic filtering, involved creating a simple recommender system that suggested popular movies with high average ratings and sufficient vote counts, providing a baseline by highlighting universally liked movies.

Advancing to content-based filtering, movie metadata such as plot, genres, actors, and directors were leveraged to generate recommendations. TF-IDF vectors and cosine similarity helped find movies similar to a given movie based on their features. The collaborative filtering approach was implemented using the Surprise library, employing Single Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict user ratings and offer personalized recommendations based on user-item interactions. Finally, a hybrid recommender system was developed, combining both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations. This multifaceted approach ensured the system could cater to diverse user preferences and deliver tailored movie suggestions.
