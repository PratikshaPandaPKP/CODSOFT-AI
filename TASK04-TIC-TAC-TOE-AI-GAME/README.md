**This task creates a Tic Tac Toe game using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI. It features a simple interface with a 3x3 grid of buttons representing the game board, and options to switch between single-player and multiplayer modes.**

**Key elements include:**

**GUI Setup:** The interface is divided into frames for the title, mode selection, and game board. Colors and fonts are set to enhance the visual appeal.


**Game Logic:** The game maintains a dictionary board to track the state of each cell. Functions are defined to update the board, check for wins or draws, and reset the game.


**Modes:** Two modes are availableâ€”single-player and multiplayer. In single-player mode, the computer makes moves using the minimax algorithm, which ensures optimal play.


**Event Handling:** The play function handles player moves, updates the board, checks for wins or draws, and triggers the computer's move in single-player mode.


**Minimax Algorithm:** This algorithm allows the computer to make optimal moves by evaluating potential future moves and choosing the one with the best outcome.
